The included binary is for linux/x86. If it doesn't work for you, you need
to compile it from source, a patch that is not integrated upstream yet is
needed.

To compile it from source on OS X:

tar -jxvf p7zip_9.13_src_all.tar.bz2
cd p7zip_9.13
patch -p1 < ../p7zip.patch
cp makefile.macosx makefile.machine
make 7z
cp bin/7z ..
cp bin/7z.so ..

On linux, do the same, just skip copying the makefile.
