The included binary is for linux/x86. If it doesn't work for you, you can
either remove it (and let the install script use unshield from somewhere
else in your PATH) or compile it from source.
For S60 3.2, though, you need specifically this version (an unpatched
unshield doesn't work).

To compile it from source:

tar -zxvf unshield-0.6.tar.gz
cd unshield-0.6
patch -p1 < ../unshield-patch
./configure --enable-shared=no
make
cp src/unshield ..


Note that this version includes a custom patch to be able to handle the
installation package for S60 3.2. This patch is not official, and is not
regression tested against other installshield packages than the ones used
by the S60 SDKs supported.
