GnuPoc tool package
===================

First you have to install the compiler needed for your SDK. The rest of
the toolchain can be used through wine, or be used in (more or less
compatible) native versions, included here.

These tools can also be used with SDKs in the sdk2unix-style by Rudolf
König.


GCC for S60 1st and 2nd ed
--------------------------

Download the source to the GCC version for symbian,
from http://www.symbianos.org/download/gcc-539-2aeh-source.tar.bz2
or http://www.martin.st/symbian/gcc-539-2aeh-source.tar.bz2. Then
compile and install it using the install_gcc_539 script:

./install_gcc_539 gcc-539-2aeh-source.tar.bz2 ~/symbian-gcc

If there are build problems, make sure curses development libraries are
installed, the errors if this is missing aren't too descriptive.


GCC for S60 3rd ed and UIQ 3
----------------------------

On linux, you can use the prebuilt binaries from CodeSourcery,
http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/arm/releases/2005Q1C,
select IA32 GNU/Linux, or from
http://www.martin.st/symbian/gnu-csl-arm-2005Q1C-arm-none-symbianelf-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2.
To use these, just extract the package to a directory:

mkdir csl-gcc
cd csl-gcc
tar -jxvf ../gnu-csl-arm-2005Q1C-arm-none-symbianelf-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2

Otherwise (on other platforms), you can build the CodeSourcery GCC from
source. Download the source package from the CodeSourcery url above, or
from
http://www.martin.st/symbian/gnu-csl-arm-2005Q1C-arm-none-symbianelf.src.tar.bz2.

In this case, compile it using the install_csl_gcc script:

./install_csl_gcc gnu-csl-arm-2005Q1C-arm-none-symbianelf.src.tar.bz2 ~/csl-gcc

This requires that you have flex and bison installed.



Additional tools
----------------

If you want to use native versions of the SDK tools instead of running
them through wine, compile and install them using the appropriate script:

./install_eka1_tools ~/symbian-gcc

or

./install_eka2_tools ~/csl-gcc

depending on which toolchain they're for.


The tools for eka2 includes a hacked version of gnu make, to handle
external makefiles which uses dos-style paths with backslashes. This,
toghether with the mifconv replacement, a symlink named rem and a small
script named del, seems to be able to handle many icon makefiles. In some,
however, there might be some case issues.

Rcomp is somewhat hacked, to handle both Symbian 6 resources (by
adding the -6 flag) and to handle some new things in resources in 9.
This included cleaning up the lexer and grammar files so that flex and
yacc could generate new code from them. This also added some changes to
the integration with the rest of the application. In practice, this might
give less informative error messages.

This package also includes a drop-in-replacement for elf2e32. It doesn't
support all the command line parameters the original one does, but works
for building binaries in all tested cases.

Makesis is a modified version of the original makesis-2 released by Symbian.
The parser has been modified to support the new pkg file syntax, the
sis file generation backend is written from scratch. This also contains
a signsis replacement and a makekeys replacement (with slightly different
syntax compared to the original makekeys).

If you have problem with any of these native tools, just remove it from
the toolchain directory, and the build scripts will use the original exe
with wine instead, and let me know about the problems.

Note, both EKA1 and EKA2 tools require zlib, the EKA2 tools also require
openssl libraries. gettext is a requirement for building the patched
make tool, if it's missing, you may get non-obvious error messages when
building.
