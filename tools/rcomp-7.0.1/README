rcomp for Linux by Alfred E. Heggestad <alfredh@symbianos.org> (27. Dec 2003)
See License.txt for further details.


TESTING

Porting and testing was done with:

    Debian GNU/Linux unstable with kernel 2.6.0 on x86

Compiler that works is gcc-2.95 (gcc-3.3 does not work yet)

Regression test code can be executed by doing 'make regtest' in the root.
This uses rcomp to generate binary .rsc files and compares them
with reference .rsc files part of the source package from Symbian Ltd.

NOTE: The generated binary .rsc files has only been verified for simple
      .rss files part of the regression test. For more complex .rss files
      (like e32frodo) I had to comment out two asserts to get it working.
      The output looks sane but has not been verified yet. To find the
      commented out asserts, grep in the source code for:

          $ grep -nrI assert . | grep TODO


SOURCE

The source code is hosted in Subversion on symbianos.org which can be
retried by doing (provided you have login):

    $ svn co svn+ssh://symbianos.org/home/svn/rcomp/trunk rcomp

Tarballs can be fetched from

    http://symbianos.org/download/

Debian packages can be installed by adding this to /etc/apt/sources.list

    deb http://ftp.symbianos.org/debian sid main
    deb-src http://ftp.symbianos.org/debian sid main

and doing

    $ apt-get update
    $ apt-get install rcomp


TODO

o Get gcc-3.3 working
o Test big-endian architectures
o Understand why the two asserts had to be commented out
