petran for Linux by Alfred E. Heggestad <alfredh@symbianos.org> (21. Dec 2003)
See License.txt for further details.


TESTING

Porting and testing was done with:

    Debian GNU/Linux unstable with kernel 2.6.0 on x86

Compiler that works is gcc-2.95 (gcc-3.3 does not work yet)

Regression test code can be executed by doing 'make regtest' in the root.
This uses to petran to generated EPOC executables and compares them
(excluding the timestamp) with reference EPOC executables generated
by the native petran.exe running under wine.
