elf2e32 replacement
-------------------

Compile this and drop into the toolchain directory, to use this instead
of the exe version through wine.

make
cp elf2e32 ~/csl-gcc/bin

This still lacks deflate compression support, and many parameters are
ignored. It manages to build correctly working binaries, in all currently
tested cases.

elf2e32 requires libelf. If you don't want to or can't install it system-wide,
a version is included here. In that case, enter libelf-0.8.9 and compile it:

cd libelf-0.8.9
./configure --enable-shared=no --prefix=`pwd`/../libelf
make
make install

Then compile elf2e32 using the makefile for local libelf:

make -f Makefile.local-libelf
