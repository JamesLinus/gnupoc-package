elf2e32 replacement
-------------------

Compile this and drop into the toolchain directory, to use this instead
of the exe version through wine.

make
cp elf2e32 ~/csl-gcc/bin

Currently some parameters are ignored. However, it manages to build correctly
working binaries, in all currently tested cases.

elf2e32 requires libelf. If you don't want to or can't install it system-wide,
a version is included here. In that case, enter libelf-0.8.9 and compile it:

cd libelf-0.8.9
./configure --enable-shared=no --prefix=`pwd`/../libelf
make
make install

Then compile elf2e32 using the makefile for local libelf:

make -f Makefile.local-libelf


The main elf2e32-code is licensed according to the GPL (see COPYING). The
deflate code is licensed according to the Symbian Example Source License
(see deflate/license.txt).
