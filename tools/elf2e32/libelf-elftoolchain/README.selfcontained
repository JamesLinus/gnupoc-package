This is a slightly modified version of libelf from elftoolchain,
modified by Martin Storsjo.

It is modified to be selfcontained, and the makefile is modified to
support gnumake.

The library also contains a few other minor modifications:
- Allow Elf_Data::d_type to differ from the type mapped from sh_type
- Allow Elf_Data::d_align to be zero
- Merged a patch by kaiwang27 at sourceforge, for supporting translation
  of verdef/verneed
